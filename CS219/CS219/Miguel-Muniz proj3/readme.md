This program reads from a file and takes the inputed operator aswell as either the  regesters in the opperands or an Itype value. The inputed to be result register is also taken. It then assigns register values to the correct array element then extracts integer values out of the register values in order for the opperation between two opperands to take place within the correct elements of the array.

If the operator is a shifting operation then it will take the input register and the amount of times to be shifted.
